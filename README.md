## :computer: System Requirements

Vagabond only supports **English Steam** versions of Skyrim AE. **GOG and other Languages are not supported**.
Only, Windows 10 and 11 work with Wabbajack fully. LTSC, special variants, lightened editions or any other modified variant **WILL NOT WORK**.

- Need reports from users before I can determine system requirements for the list. 10GB of vram and 32GB of ram is recommended. You might get away with 8GB vram / 16Gb ram.

My specs (1440p 21x9, DLSS performance, 45-60 fps on most exterior areas):

- i9 9900K
- 32GB DDR4
- NVME M.2
- RTX 2080ti

Space required: Approx 452GB install + 262GB downloads (can delete after install) + 30GB working room for Wabbajack.

:warning: **NOTE**: AMD RX 580 and HDD installations are **not supported**. :warning:
